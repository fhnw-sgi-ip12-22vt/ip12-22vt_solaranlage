welcomeText=Welcome to the Solar Simulator!
gameExplanation1=In this game, the aim is to optimize the power consumption of your single-family home and use various private electrical appliances to consume as much energy as possible from the photovoltaic system.
rulesTitle=Here are the rules:
rule1=The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by optimizing the power consumption of the single-family home and using as much renewable energy as possible.
rule2=You start the game in a single-family home with a curve showing the impact of solar power. This curve shows the amount of electricity available at certain times of the day.
rule3=To turn on devices, you need to click on them. The more devices you turn on, the more points you get. But be careful: if you consume too much power, you lose points.
rule4=You need to turn on the devices within the curve. If you turn on devices when no solar power is available, you also lose points.
rule5=There are different types of devices that consume different amounts of power. For example, a television consumes more power than a light bulb. So choose wisely which devices you turn on.
rule6=To win, you need to try to turn on as many devices as possible within the curve and use the maximum amount of energy. In addition, each device should be switched on for a certain period of time.
rule7=Note that the flow of electricity is influenced by solar activity and weather conditions. More solar power flows on sunny days than on cloudy days.
rule8=Some devices need to be on all the time, like the refrigerator, while others only need to be activated as needed, like the guitar. Make sure to turn on the right devices at the right time to achieve optimal power consumption.
closingText=Have fun playing and discovering the world of renewable energies!
